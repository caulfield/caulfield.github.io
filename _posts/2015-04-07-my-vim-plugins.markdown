I've been using vim for several years and I can't imagine my all workflow without it. Vim is very fast and extensible. I've included these plugins as my configuration for ruby/ruby-on-rails development.
I'm describing all plugins from my `.vimrc` you can find [there][myvimrc]. [vim-plug][vim-plug] is my plugin manager.

#####[`Plug 'altercation/vim-colors-solarized'`][vim-colors-solarized]

> Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications

#####[`Plug 'kien/ctrlp.vim'`][ctrlp.vim]

> Full path fuzzy file, buffer, mru, tag, ... finder for Vim.

#####[`Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree'`][NERDTree]

> The NERD tree allows you to explore your filesystem and to open files and directories. It presents the filesystem to you in the form of a tree which you manipulate with the keyboard and/or mouse. It also allows you to perform simple filesystem operations.

#####[`Plug 'Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin'`][nerdtree-git-plugin]

> A plugin of NERDTree showing git status flags.

#####[`Plug 'bling/vim-airline'`][vim-airline]

> Lean & mean status/tabline for vim that's light as air.

#####[`Plug 'jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs'`][vim-nerdtree-tabs]

> This plugin aims at making NERDTree feel like a true panel, independent of tabs.
